# Dynamic Blog Website using Flask

## Description

I developed a dynamic blog website using the Flask framework, enabling users to create accounts, publish blog posts, and interact with other users. The website features a modern and user-friendly interface, allowing for easy navigation and content discovery.

## Key Features:
- User Registration and Authentication: Implemented user registration and login functionality using Flask-WTF forms and secure password hashing.
- Blog Post Management: Users can create, edit, and delete their blog posts, with support for rich text formatting and media embedding.
- User Interaction: Enabled users to like and comment on blog posts, fostering engagement and community interaction.
- Responsive Design: Designed the website with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing experience across devices of varying screen sizes.
- Robust Backend: Utilized Flask's powerful routing and templating capabilities to create a scalable and maintainable backend architecture.

## Technologies Used:
- Flask: Micro web framework for Python
- Flask-WTF: Flask extension for handling web forms and CSRF protection
- HTML/CSS: Frontend markup and styling
- SQLite: Lightweight relational database for storing user accounts and blog posts
- Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive design
- JavaScript: Client-side scripting for interactive elements

## Challenges and Solutions:
One of the main challenges I encountered was implementing user authentication and ensuring secure password storage. I addressed this by leveraging Flask-Login for session management and Werkzeug's security features for password hashing.
